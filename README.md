# Doramogo Downloader

Just a simple script for downloading episodes of doramas from the "doramogo.com" website.
I created this script for personal use and learning purposes, but if you want to use it for testing...
Currently, it only downloads videos from the following providers: Google Drive, Rumble. Additional providers may not be added later.

**Dependencies:**
You need to install `youtube-dl` using pip:

```bash
pip install youtube-dl
```

To download a drama series from Doramongo.com, simply copy the link of the desired drama series and paste it in the terminal.
  Example:
  ```
  Link: https://doramogo.com/dorama/a-business-proposal/
  ```
